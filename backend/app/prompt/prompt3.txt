Script: Ultrasound Exam for Ovarian Cysts

Interior – Medical Examination Room – Day

Soft ambient lighting fills the room. The environment is calm, clean, and clinical, with subtle beeping from medical equipment in the background.

Scene opens:

A female sonographer, dressed in a white medical coat and wearing medical gloves, stands beside the examination table near the patient’s lower body. 
She holds an ultrasound probe in one hand and gently reaches under the modesty drape to begin the examination, ensuring the patient’s comfort throughout the procedure.

Close-up shot:
The ultrasound screen comes to life with grayscale imaging, revealing cross-sectional views of the patient’s uterus and ovaries in real time. The doctor moves the probe slowly and deliberately, adjusting angles to obtain clearer views.

Patient’s face is calm and focused on the ceiling or softly turning toward the monitor, curious but relaxed.
